# codepair 

This extension allows you to invite other people for help when you are stuck. This is done by connecting to that person through a client server session and syncing the code file accross both of them.

## How to use
* Start the extension on both machines by typing in the command `Activate CodePair`
* On one machine, open command window (press F1) and type `get help`, press enter, and key in the ip address of other machine.
* On second machine, open command window and type `send help`

The machines are now connected and edits done by one are visible on another.

## Requirements

* Machines need to be on the same network
* IP address of the person helping
* The person giving help needs to initiate the request
